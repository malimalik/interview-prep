## Repository purpose 
As I am reviewing data structures and algorithms from college and applying them to coding questions on leetcode, I want to document my journey as I get better at them and find more than one, and hopefully and optimized way, to solve a particular problem. I am a big believer in being efficient in everything one does and I have found that the best way to learn is to learn different patterns that these leetcode/white-board coding questions fall under. How did I come to this conclusion? 

I was first exposed to leetcode in May of 2020, and I did a question every now and then but I had no goal and was not getting better. It helps to have structure, which I hope to create that in this repository, and maintain it as well. 

I will do the following topics: 
1. Arrays and Strings 
2. Hashing 
3. Linked Lists
4. Stacks and Queues
5. Trees and Graphs 
6. Heaps
7. Greedy
8. Binary Search
9. Backtracking
10. Dynamic Programming
